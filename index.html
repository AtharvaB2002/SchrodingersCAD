                <h2>1. What is Quantum Computing?</h2>
                <p>Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum mechanics principles such as superposition, entanglement, and interference to perform calculations. Quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) instead of classical bits to perform operations. This allows quantum computers to solve problems that classical computers cannot, such as factorizing large numbers, simulating complex physical systems, and optimizing logistics problems.</p>

                <h2>2. Quantum Mechanics</h2>
                <p>Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that studies the behavior of particles at the quantum level. In quantum mechanics, particles can exist in multiple states at the same time, known as superposition. Quantum mechanics also allows for particles to become entangled, which means their states become correlated even when separated by large distances.</p>

                <h2>3. Quantum Gates</h2>
                <p>Quantum gates are the equivalent of classical logic gates in quantum computing. They are used to manipulate the state of qubits in order to perform operations on quantum information. Some of the most common quantum gates include the Hadamard gate, the Pauli-X gate, and the CNOT gate.</p>
